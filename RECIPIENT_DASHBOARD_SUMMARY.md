## ✅ Completed Implementation

### 🎯 Goal Achieved
Implemented a **full-featured recipient dashboard** for FoodBridge that mirrors the donor dashboard UX with advanced filtering, pagination, and role-based protection.

- Checks Supabase authentication
- Validates user role
- Redirects unauthorized users
- Supports role mapping (restaurant→donor, ngo→recipient)

### 2. **FilterBar Component** (`src/pages/recipient-dashboard/components/FilterBar.jsx`)
- ✅ Debounced search (300ms)
- ✅ Category, urgency, status filters
- ✅ Date range picker (start/end dates)

### 3. **ActiveFoodPosts Component** (`src/pages/recipient-dashboard/components/ActiveFoodPosts.jsx`)
- ✅ Pagination (12 items per page)
- ✅ Smart page controls with ellipsis
- ✅ Skeleton loading states
- ✅ Empty state UI
- ✅ Responsive grid
- ✅ Reuses FoodPostCard from donor-dashboard

### 4. **RecentPosts Widget** (`src/pages/recipient-dashboard/components/RecentPosts.jsx`)
- ✅ Shows last 5-10 posts
- ✅ Compact sidebar layout
- ✅ Click to view details
- ✅ Time ago formatting

### 5. **Enhanced Recipient Dashboard** (`src/pages/recipient-dashboard/index.jsx`)
- ✅ Two-column layout
- ✅ Metrics cards
- ✅ Filter integration
- ✅ Pagination with auto-reset
- ✅ 24 mock posts for testing
- ✅ Mobile responsive

### 6. **Route Protection** (`src/Routes.jsx`)
- ✅ Protected donor routes (donor/restaurant only)

- ✅ Protected shared routes (profile, settings)

### 7. **Registration Enhancement** (`src/pages/register/index.jsx`)

## 🏗️ Architecture Notes

### Design Patterns Used
1. **Component Composition** - FilterBar, ActiveFoodPosts, RecentPosts as separate concerns
2. **DRY Principle** - Reused FoodPostCard, MetricsCard, UI components
3. **localStorage Strategy** - Persist filters for better UX
4. **Debouncing** - Prevent excessive re-renders on search
5. **Responsive Design** - Mobile-first Tailwind classes
6. **Loading States** - Skeleton loaders for perceived performance

### Mock Data Strategy
- Currently uses client-side mock data (24 posts)
- Mirrors donor-dashboard pattern
- Ready for Supabase migration
- Filtering logic encapsulated for easy replacement

### Future Backend Integration
When ready, replace `allFoodPosts` with:
```javascript
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('food_posts')
  .select('*')
  .eq('category', filters.category)
  .range(page * 12, (page + 1) * 12 - 1);
```

## 📝 Quick Start Guide

### For Developers
1. Navigate to `/recipient-dashboard` as an NGO user
2. Use filters to narrow down food posts
3. Pagination handles large datasets (currently 24 mock posts)
4. Click any post to view details
5. Filters persist across page refreshes

### For QA Testing
```bash
# 1. Register as NGO
Go to /register → Select "NGO" → Complete form → Redirected to /recipient-dashboard

# 2. Test Filters
Search: "curry" → See filtered results
Category: "Bakery" → See only bakery items
Clear Filters → Reset to all

# 3. Test Pagination
Scroll to bottom → Click "Next" → Page 2 loads
Click page number "3" → Jump to page 3

# 4. Test Protection
Logout → Try to access /recipient-dashboard → Redirected to /login
Login as restaurant → Try /recipient-dashboard → Redirected to /donor-dashboard
```
